Based on the analysis, there are clear differences in how casual riders and members use Cyclistic bikes, which provides opportunities to convert casual riders into annual members. For instance, casual riders exhibit peak usage during the afternoon and early evenings, suggesting recreational use, while members predominantly ride during traditional commuting hours. (1) To capitalize on this, Cyclistic can offer time-sensitive membership promotions aimed at casual riders during peak usage times, such as around noon (e.g., 11 AM to 1 PM) and in the early evening (e.g., starting around 5 PM). These promotions could include discounted membership trials, ride credits, or a "commuter's package" that allows casual users to experience the service as part of their daily routine. Additionally, campaigns should highlight the cost savings and convenience of membership for frequent riders, focusing on the benefits of incorporating biking into their daily activities during these popular riding times.

The data also reveals that both casual riders and members show a strong preference for classic bikes. (2) Cyclistic can focus on promoting the reliability and affordability of classic bikes as a core feature of membership, showcasing them as the most practical choice for frequent, everyday use. This could involve offering classic bike discounts or rewards for casual riders who transition to membership, helping them see the value in upgrading from occasional to regular use with a stable and familiar ride option. Additionally, since casual riders have a notable interest in electric bikes (with 553,724 rides), Cyclistic could introduce targeted marketing campaigns highlighting the advantages of both classic and electric bikes. 

Promoting the speed and convenience of electric bikes could attract casual riders who might be interested in a faster commuting option while providing clear comparisons to classic bikes to show the benefits of each. Furthermore, for those using docked bikes, Cyclistic can design promotions specifically for them, such as offering ride credits for choosing docked bikes over other types. By emphasizing the versatility of membership and providing tailored benefits, Cyclistic can effectively cater to the diverse preferences of casual riders, increasing the likelihood of converting them into dedicated members.

(3) Additionally, Cyclistic can set up exclusive promotions at popular casual rider stations, like Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, where casual riders frequently start their trips. By placing kiosks, targeted ads, and in-app notifications at these stations, Cyclistic can emphasize the financial and practical benefits of becoming a member, especially for those who ride frequently from these high-traffic locations. To further entice casual riders, Cyclistic could offer instant sign-up incentives, such as discounted first rides or a free month of membership for new sign-ups made at these kiosks. Partnering with local businesses near these stations for cross-promotions, like discounts at nearby cafes or shops for members, could also enhance the appeal and create a community-focused atmosphere, making membership more attractive to casual riders.
